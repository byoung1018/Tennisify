Have you ever wanted to go out and play a game with other people but just give up because it's too painful to set it up?  I have this annoyance every I want to play tennis which ends up having even more constraints.  If I want to play singles, I can't email multiple people because people might respond so I'm reduced to emailing people one at a time, waiting for somebody to say they can play just to hope I don't have to email somebody else.
